      We are currently evaluating various options that use existing technologies and standards to implement and demonstrate a scalable approach that does not require a centralized "trust registry", changes to DNS infrastructure, changes to Certificate Authorities, or changes to browser trust store governance processes.

Transactions conducted on the web between entities are reliant on trusted introductions over widely available infrastructure. 

Trusted introductions are done using identifiers that represent the entities. 

For high value transactions, such as credential issuance and verification, confidence that the identifiers represent and are controlled by the entities participating in the transactions are a necessary first step. 

The technical building blocks that make such trusted introductions possible are:

## Digital Signatures & PKI

...

## Domain Name System & DNSSEC

...

## Self-Certifying Identifiers & DIDs

...
